I present an implementation of the sliding window algorithm that was published in the year 2002 by Mayur Datar, Aristidis Gionis,
Piotr Indyk and Rajeev Motwani in the paper "Maintaining Stream Statistics Over Sliding Windows":
  
http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~datar/papers/sicomp_streams.pdf
  
The algorithm was the subject of my masterÂ´s thesis in 2019. I use the implementation for the purpose of training my programming skills.
 
For the exact description of the algorithm, see page 1800 of the paper above.
The algorithm is implemented in the class "SlidingWindowHistogram" with the method "updateHistogram".
